# Bank-note-authentication
This is a flasgger application that finds out whether a currency note is real or fake.
Firstly the specifications of bank notes is provided as a csv file.
Then certain EDA and machine learning algorithms are applied to predict whether the note is real or fake.
The algorithms used for this project are KNeighbors and Random forest classifier, out of which the knn algorithm gave a 100% accuracy.
